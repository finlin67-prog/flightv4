I want to enhance the Quick Assessment page so that it shows “live recommended journeys so far…” as the user answers questions.

Context:
- I already have:
  - A Quick Assessment page inside the CockpitLayout.
  - A journeys data model in something like `src/data/journeys.js` which exports:
    - `journeys` (array of journey configs)
    - `toPoints(combinedScore)` helper
  - A Flight Deck / Journeys page that displays journeys more fully.
  - A new live flight status mechanism from the previous change (Quick Assessment now computes a `liveAssessmentScore`, `liveCombinedScore`, etc., and may expose them through a context or state).

Goal:
- While the user is on the Quick Assessment page and answering questions:
  - Compute a live points value from the partial answers.
  - Use that to suggest 2–4 journeys from the `journeys` catalog.
  - Update this list in real time as answers change.
  - Display this list in a section below the questions, titled something like:
    - “Based on your answers so far, here are possible journeys:”
  - Allow the user to click a journey card to go to the main Flight Deck / Journeys page (optionally with that journey preselected).

Please do the following:

1) Import journeys data into Quick Assessment
   - In the Quick Assessment page component (the same one we used to add live scoring), import:
     - `journeys` and `toPoints` from `src/data/journeys` (or the correct path).
   - Also import any helper that converts combined score to a plane/points if we created one (e.g., from `flightMetrics`).

2) Compute live points for recommendations
   - Use the existing live combined score (from previous work) if available. If not, compute it here as:
     - `liveCombinedScore = liveAssessmentScore / 10` (0–10).
   - Then derive points:
     - `const livePoints = toPoints(liveCombinedScore);`
   - If no answers are selected yet, `livePoints` can be 0 and we can either show nothing or a friendly message.

3) Define a simple recommendation logic
   - Create a small helper function inside the Quick Assessment component or a separate file, e.g. `getLiveJourneySuggestions(journeys, livePoints, maxCount = 3)`.
   - For now, use a *simple heuristic*:
     - Filter `journeys` where `journey.minPoints` is:
       - `<= livePoints + 100` (so we show things that are reachable soon).
     - Optionally sort by:
       - `journey.minPoints` ascending, so nearer journeys appear first.
   - From this filtered list, take the top 3–4 journeys as the “live suggestions”.
   - If `livePoints` is 0, either:
     - Show a placeholder text like “Answer a few questions to see suggested journeys,” or
     - Don’t show journey cards yet.

   - It’s okay if we ignore the full `recommendedDimensions` and `requiredTools` for now; we can add more sophisticated filtering later. Right now we want a simple, intuitive mapping based on the emerging score.

4) Add a “Live Journey Suggestions” section to the Quick Assessment UI
   - In the Quick Assessment page layout, below the main question content (and above any final footer), add a new section component or JSX block.
   - It should include:
     - A title: “Based on your answers so far…”
     - Subtext: “These journeys may be a good fit. You’ll see more precise recommendations once you complete the assessment.”
   - For each suggested journey:
     - Render a card with:
       - Journey title (e.g., “From Spray & Pray to Targeted ABM”).
       - Short summary (from `journey.summary`).
       - Origin → Destination line (e.g., “Demand Gen → ABM” or “Seattle → Chicago” if present).
       - A small pill showing required points, e.g., “Recommended starting at 350+ miles”.
       - Optional text: “Requires: CRM, MAP, analytics…” based on `journey.requiredTools`.
   - Keep the design consistent with the existing cards on the Flight Deck page (buttons, colors, etc.), but this can be a slightly simpler version since it’s a preview.

5) Live update behavior
   - Ensure that whenever the user selects or changes an answer:
     - Live score updates (as implemented in the previous prompt).
     - `livePoints` recomputes.
     - The list of suggested journeys recomputes.
   - The UI should feel responsive, like a pilot seeing their potential destinations become available as the aircraft gains range.

6) Click behavior for each suggested journey
   - When a user clicks on a journey card (or a “View this journey” button on the card):
     - Navigate them to the main Flight Deck / Journeys page (whatever route you use for that, e.g. `/app/journeys` or `/flight-deck`).
   - If reasonable, also:
     - Pass along the selected journey id, either via:
       - React Router state, e.g. `navigate("/app/journeys", { state: { selectedJourneyId: journey.id }})`, or
       - A query parameter, e.g. `/app/journeys?selected=journey.id`, or
       - A shared context.
     - On the Flight Deck page, if it sees `selectedJourneyId`, it can:
       - Scroll to or highlight that journey,
       - Or open a detail view for that journey.
   - If wiring the selection is too complex right now, at minimum just navigate to the Flight Deck and we can wire the “preselected journey” behavior later.

7) Don’t disturb existing backend logic
   - The actual official set of recommended journeys after full assessment completion should remain based on the backend-calculated results, the tech stack, etc.
   - This new “Live suggestions so far” section is simply a **preview** during Quick Assessment to make the experience more engaging.

8) Clean and reusable code
   - If the Live Journey Suggestions section becomes bigger, consider factoring it out into a reusable component, e.g.:
     - `src/components/LiveJourneySuggestions.jsx`
     - Props might include `points`, `journeys`, `onSelectJourney`.
   - This could later be used in other parts of the app if needed.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT delete or radically rewrite the Quick Assessment or Flight Deck pages.
- Do NOT change the backend APIs.
- Only ADD the live suggestion logic and the new UI section on the Quick Assessment page.
- Keep the layout within the existing CockpitLayout.
- Show me which files you changed and where the new suggestion helper or component lives.
