The Quick Assessment page looks great but feels too crowded, especially with:
- Global left navigation (Cockpit sidebar)
- Question Status section on the left inside the main content
- Full-width question card
- Right Flight Instruments sidebar

I don’t want to remove the global left nav (that’s part of the cockpit), but I DO want the Quick Assessment content area to feel less busy.

Please adjust the Quick Assessment layout as follows:

1) Make the in-page “Question Status” panel collapsible:
   - This is the panel inside the main content (not the global left nav) that lists:
     - Marketing Strategy, Content Marketing, Demand Generation, etc. with checkmarks.
   - Wrap this panel in a collapsible section or accordion:
     - Default state on desktop: expanded is fine, but use a smaller width and clear separation.
     - On smaller screens: default to collapsed to save space.
   - Provide a small header like:
     - “Question Status (10/10 answered)” with a toggle caret or “Show/Hide” link.
   - When collapsed, only the header is visible; the list of topics is hidden.

2) Reduce horizontal density:
   - Ensure the main center area (question card + answer options) has more horizontal space:
     - If necessary, slightly reduce the max-width of the question card so there’s more margin between the card and the right sidebar.
   - The goal is that the main question and answers feel easy to read, not squeezed.

3) Top summary bar:
   - Keep or add a slim top bar in the Quick Assessment main content with:
     - “Live flight status active – Watch your instruments update in real-time.”
     - Progress: “10 of 10 questions answered” with a progress bar.
   - This helps orient the user and allows you to remove any redundant text that might be crowding the question area.

4) Don’t touch the global left nav or right instruments:
   - The global cockpit left nav (Control Tower, Quick Scan, Deep Dives, etc.) should stay.
   - The right Flight Instruments sidebar should stay as implemented, including collapse behavior if we added it earlier.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT remove the global left navigation or the right Flight Instruments sidebar.
- Do NOT change the underlying assessment logic or API calls.
- Only adjust the in-page layout for Quick Assessment (especially the “Question Status” block) to reduce visual clutter.
- Show me which files you changed and how to toggle the Question Status panel.
