The What-If Simulator is very cool, but right now it feels siloed as its own page.

I’d like to:
- Keep the simulator functionality.
- But ALSO surface it directly within the main Results / Flight Status page so users can tweak scenarios in context of their results.

Current state:
- There is a dedicated “Simulator” page/route with sliders for Budget Change, Headcount Change, Tech Utilization Change, and Process Maturity Change.
- It shows an error dialog if the scenario API fails (e.g., “Error running simulation. Please try again.”).
- The Results page (Flight Status) is a separate page that shows:
  - Total Flight Miles
  - REAO cards
  - Insights
  - “What Now?” section with CTAs including a button to go to the What-If Simulator.

Please do the following refactor:

1) Extract the simulator UI into a reusable component:
   - Create a component file like:
     - `src/components/ScenarioSimulatorPanel.jsx`
   - Move the core UI from the Simulator page into this component:
     - Sliders for Budget Change, Headcount Change, Tech Utilization, Process Maturity.
     - The “Run Simulation” button and logic that calls the backend.
     - The “Current vs Projected Aircraft” comparison display.
   - Make this component accept props where needed (e.g., baseline assessment id) and handle its own local state.

2) Use the reusable component in two places:
   a) Existing Simulator route:
      - Keep the current Simulator page/route, but replace most of its JSX with:
        - `<ScenarioSimulatorPanel />`
      - So existing functionality is preserved.

   b) Flight Status / Results page:
      - On the Flight Status page (the page that shows total Flight Miles, REAO metrics, etc.), add a new section near the bottom (or under “Ready for Takeoff”) that embeds:
        - `<ScenarioSimulatorPanel />` in a more compact layout.
      - This makes the simulator feel like a continuation of the results.

3) Compact layout for embedded version:
   - For the version on the Results page:
     - It’s okay if you pass a prop like `compact` to `ScenarioSimulatorPanel` to:
       - Reduce padding.
       - Possibly show the sliders and comparison in a 2-column layout.
   - The standalone Simulator page can still use the full layout.

4) Error handling:
   - Ensure that if the simulation errors (e.g., API returns error), the error message is shown inline in the panel (e.g., a small alert box), not only as a browser dialog.
   - The old behavior of alert dialogs popping up is jarring; replace them with UI-level feedback where possible.

5) Wiring to the latest assessment:
   - If the simulator requires an `assessment_id`:
     - Try to pull it from:
       - The latest completed assessment shown on the Results page (e.g., from context or props).
     - If none is available, either:
       - Disable the simulator and show a message (“Complete an assessment to use the simulator”), or
       - Ask the user to pick an assessment from a small dropdown.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT remove the simulator functionality or its route.
- Do NOT break existing API calls to the scenario estimate endpoint.
- Only refactor the UI into a reusable component and embed it in the Flight Status page as an additional section.
- Show me which files you changed and how to use `ScenarioSimulatorPanel`.
