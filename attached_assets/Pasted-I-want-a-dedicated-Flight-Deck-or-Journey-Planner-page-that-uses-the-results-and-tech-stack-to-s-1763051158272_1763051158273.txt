I want a dedicated “Flight Deck” or “Journey Planner” page that uses the results and tech stack to suggest journeys.

Task:
1. Create a new page, for example:
   - `src/pages/FlightDeckPage.js`

2. Data inputs:
   - This page should read:
     - The latest assessment results (scores, REAO scores, plane level, etc.).
     - The tech stack inventory (if available) from global state or context.
   - If needed, it can also fetch recent assessment history from `/api/assessment/history` and use the latest assessment as the basis.

3. On this page, show:
   - A summary of the current “plane level” and points.
   - A highlight of key weak areas (e.g., lowest-scoring REAO dimensions or functions).

4. Recommended journeys:
   - For each weak area, create a “journey card” that includes:
     - A journey title (e.g., “From Spray & Pray to Targeted ABM”).
     - Origin & destination functions (e.g., Demand Gen → ABM).
     - Required layovers (e.g., Marketing Operations, Analytics, Data).
     - A short explanation and 3–5 suggested next steps.

   - The journeys should conceptually connect:
     - Maturity gaps (low scores on certain topics)
     - Tech gaps (missing or under-optimized tools from the tech stack assessment)

5. “I feel lucky” option:
   - Add a button “I feel lucky”.
   - When clicked, select 4–5 journeys (either from recommendations or a predefined catalog) and show them as cards even if they’re not the highest priority, to inspire exploration.

6. Navigation:
   - Add a route to this Flight Deck page from the main navigation or the Results page, such as a button “Open Flight Deck” on the Results page.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT delete or radically rewrite existing files.
- Do NOT remove existing pages or routing.
- You ARE allowed to create new pages, new components, and new routes where needed.
- Only ADD or MODIFY what is necessary.
- Keep existing pages and routing working.
- Show me exactly which files you changed.
