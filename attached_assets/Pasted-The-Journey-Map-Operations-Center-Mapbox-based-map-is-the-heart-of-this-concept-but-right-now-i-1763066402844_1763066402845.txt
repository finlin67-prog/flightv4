The Journey Map / Operations Center (Mapbox-based map) is the heart of this concept, but right now it is:

- Buried at the bottom of a results page.
- Only reachable via a small button labeled Operations Center or similar.
- Visually crowded with too many surrounding columns/panels.
- The map background sometimes does not load correctly.

I want the Map to be a first-class destination in the cockpit, easy to find and visually central.

Please make the following changes:

1) Promote the Map to its own clear route:
   - Create or confirm a dedicated route such as `/app/journey-map` or `/app/map`.
   - In the left cockpit navigation, add or rename an item to:
     - Label: “Journey Map” or “Flight Map”.
     - Icon: e.g., a map or route icon.
   - Clicking this nav item should always take the user to the full Map view.

2) Use the existing map page as the basis:
   - Identify the current component that renders the map (likely under names like `OperationsCenter`, `JourneyMap`, `MapView`).
   - Make this the content for the `Journey Map` route, but improve its layout as described below.

3) Simplify the Map layout:
   - The center of the screen should be the Map itself, using most of the horizontal space.
   - Around it, we can have supporting panels, but they should not crush the map.
   - Suggested layout:
     - Within the CockpitLayout center area:
       - Left column: a small card with current aircraft, overall readiness score, and a toggle for “Show Connections”.
       - Middle: the Map (large).
       - Right column: Strategic Insights and city legend (stacked).
   - Alternatively:
     - Place the Map full-width at the top of the main area, and put Strategic Insights and legend below it.
   - The key requirement is that the Map is visually dominant and easy to interact with.

4) Fix map background / style issues:
   - Ensure the Mapbox map is correctly initialized:
     - Check that we are using a valid Mapbox style URL.
     - Check that we are using the correct environment variable/token (e.g., `MAPBOX_TOKEN`), and that it’s being read correctly on the frontend.
   - If the background isn’t loading due to style URL or token, update the JS to:
     - Log clear errors to the console.
     - Show a friendly message in the UI if the map cannot load (instead of a blank gray box).

5) Surface the Map from other key pages:
   - On the Flight Status / Results page:
     - In the “What Now?” or “Ready for Takeoff” section, add a button:
       - Label: “Open Journey Map”.
       - This should navigate to the `/app/journey-map` route.
   - On the Flight Deck / Journeys page:
     - Add a secondary action: “View these journeys on the map” that also routes to the Journey Map.

6) Keep right instruments and left nav as part of the cockpit:
   - The Journey Map page should still live inside the CockpitLayout:
     - Global left nav visible.
     - Right Flight Instruments visible (or collapsible if that behavior exists).
   - But the central area should be tuned so the Map has priority.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT remove the Map component or its data logic.
- Do NOT change how city data or scores are loaded for the map (beyond fixing obviously incorrect style/token usage).
- Only:
  - Promote it to its own nav route,
  - Simplify its layout so the map is central,
  - Ensure it loads reliably,
  - Add clear entry points from Results and Flight Deck.
- Show me which files you changed and what the new Journey Map route is.
