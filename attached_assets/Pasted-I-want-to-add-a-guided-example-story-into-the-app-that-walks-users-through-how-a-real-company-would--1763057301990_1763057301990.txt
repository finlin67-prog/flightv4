I want to add a guided example story into the app that walks users through how a real company would use the Marketing Flight Deck.

This should be a **non-editable, pre-filled example** based on “Company A” that explains how to use the tool step by step.

Please do the following:

1. Create a new page/component:
   - `src/pages/CompanyAStoryPage.js`

2. Structure:
   - This page should be a multi-step walkthrough with a simple stepper:
     - Show one “step” at a time.
     - Include **Next** and **Back** buttons.
     - Show the current step number and total (e.g., “Step 2 of 6”).

3. Content:
   Use the following story content to populate the steps. You can adjust wording lightly to keep it concise, but keep the meaning and sequence:

   --- STORY START ---

   Step 1: Company A Overview
   - Title: “Meet Company A”
   - Body:
     - “Company A is a $1B revenue healthcare company with a 10-person B2B marketing team and a $1M annual marketing budget.”
     - “They have strong content capabilities but no real SEO strategy, no ABM program, and an under-utilized tech stack.”
     - “They currently use HubSpot as CRM and marketing automation, plus GA4 and a basic CMS.”

   Step 2: Defining the Flight Profile
   - Title: “Boarding: Setting the Context”
   - Body:
     - “The Marketing Ops Manager at Company A logs into the Flight Deck.”
     - “They select: Role = Marketing Operations, Goals = Improve performance & understand possibilities.”
     - “They define the company profile: $1B revenue, 10-person team, Healthcare, B2B.”
     - “This context helps size the aircraft and shape the recommended journeys.”

   Step 3: Quick Assessment
   - Title: “Quick Scan: Where Are We Now?”
   - Body:
     - “Company A completes the 10-question Quick Assessment.”
     - “They score well on Content and Team, but lower on Demand Gen, Tech Stack, and ABM.”
     - “The system calculates a combined score of about 4.2, or ~420 points.”
     - “Their current aircraft is a Regional Jet ✈️ — capable of meaningful trips, but not long-haul global programs yet.”

   Step 4: Deep Dives & Tech Stack
   - Title: “Deep Dives and Tech Hangar”
   - Body:
     - “Next, Company A runs Deep Dives on Demand Gen and SEO.”
     - “They discover that while content is strong, there’s almost no SEO strategy, and limited measurement of organic impact.”
     - “In the Tech Stack Hangar, they list HubSpot, GA4, and their CMS — but realize utilization, reporting clarity, and ownership are all only mid-level.”
     - “The Flight Deck now understands both their capabilities and the actual tools in their hangar.”

   Step 5: Flight Deck Recommendations
   - Title: “Recommended Journeys”
   - Body:
     - “With assessments and tech stack in place, the Flight Deck recommends three journeys for Company A:”
       1. “From Content Islands to Connected SEO Journeys” (Content → SEO & Demand)
       2. “From Spray & Pray to Targeted ABM” (Demand Gen → ABM)
       3. “From AI Ideas to Integrated Stack” (AI → MarTech Integration)
     - “Each journey shows origin and destination, required layovers (like Operations and Analytics), and a suggested flight plan of next steps.”
     - “For example, the Content → SEO journey focuses on making their strong content discoverable and tied to pipeline.”

   Step 6: Scenario Simulator
   - Title: “Testing What-If Scenarios”
   - Body:
     - “Company A opens the Scenario Simulator and tries a few scenarios:”
       - “Scenario 1: Add 3 headcount (SEO, Analytics, Ops). Result: a jump from Regional Jet to Commercial Jet 🛫 and a significant increase in Opportunity.”
       - “Scenario 2: Migrate from HubSpot to Salesforce + Marketo. Result: only a small improvement unless processes and SEO are improved, too.”
       - “Scenario 3: Improve SEO sophistication and tech utilization by 20%. Result: stronger gains in efficiency and opportunity than a pure platform swap.”
     - “The takeaway: investing in SEO and operationalizing existing tools yields more impact than a disruptive platform migration.”

   Step 7: The Decision
   - Title: “From Score to Flight Plan”
   - Body:
     - “Instead of leaping straight into an expensive CRM/MAP migration, Company A sees a clearer, lower-risk path:”
       - “Establish a strategic SEO function.”
       - “Connect content, SEO, and Demand Gen more tightly.”
       - “Improve HubSpot utilization and reporting before considering a platform change.”
     - “The Flight Deck gives them not just a maturity score, but a practical flight plan and a way to communicate tradeoffs to leadership.”

   Step 8: How You Can Use the Flight Deck
   - Title: “Your Turn to Fly”
   - Body:
     - “You can use the Flight Deck the same way as Company A:”
       - “Onboarding: Define your role and company profile.”
       - “Assessments: Run a Quick Scan, Deep Dives, and map your Tech Stack.”
       - “Results: See your aircraft, points, and REAO profile.”
       - “Flight Deck: Explore suggested journeys and what-if scenarios.”
     - “The goal isn’t a perfect score — it’s choosing the best next trips for your team with eyes wide open.”

   --- STORY END ---

4. UI layout:
   - Use a card or panel layout for each step with:
     - A title
     - Body text
     - Optional small icon or emoji (e.g., 🧩, 🛫, 🧭, 🔮)
   - Add a simple progress indicator at the top like “Step X of 8”.

5. Navigation from elsewhere:
   - Add a way to navigate to this new page from:
     - The Landing page (e.g., a link or button labeled “See Company A Example”).
     - And/or from the Flight Deck page (e.g., “See a sample Flight Deck story”).
   - Use a route like `/story/company-a` for this page.

6. Routing:
   - Register the new route in the app’s router (where other pages are defined).
   - Ensure you do not break the initial route behavior (the app should still start at the Landing/Welcome page as before).

Important constraints:
- Do NOT delete or radically rewrite existing files.
- Do NOT remove existing pages or routing.
- You ARE allowed to create new files, new components, and new routes where needed.
- Only ADD or MODIFY what is necessary.
- Keep existing pages and routing working.
- Show me exactly which files you changed.
