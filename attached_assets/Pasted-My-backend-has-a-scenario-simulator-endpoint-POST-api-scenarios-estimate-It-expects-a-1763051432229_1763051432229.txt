My backend has a scenario simulator endpoint:
- POST /api/scenarios/estimate
- It expects:
  - `assessment_id` (string)
  - `scenario` object with:
    - budget_pct (float, -50 to +50)
    - headcount (int, -10 to +10)
    - tech_utilization_pct (float, -30 to +30)
    - process_maturity_pct (float, -20 to +20)
- It returns adjusted REAO scores, a new combined score, a new plane level, and some delta insights.

Task:
1. Create a new page or component, for example:
   - `src/pages/ScenarioSimulatorPage.js`

2. Inputs:
   - Let the user pick an existing assessment. For now:
     - You can fetch `/api/assessment/history` and let the user select an `assessment_id` from a dropdown, or
     - Just use the most recent assessment by default if that’s easier.

   - Add UI controls (sliders or numeric inputs) for:
     - Budget change (%) from -50 to +50
     - Headcount change (integer, -10 to +10)
     - Tech utilization change (%) from -30 to +30
     - Process maturity change (%) from -20 to +20

3. When the user clicks “Simulate”:
   - Call POST `/api/scenarios/estimate` with:
     - `assessment_id` = the chosen assessment
     - `scenario` = { budget_pct, headcount, tech_utilization_pct, process_maturity_pct }

4. Display:
   - The base scores vs adjusted scores (for REAO dimensions).
   - The new combined score and new plane level.
   - The “delta_insights” returned by the API (e.g., “Efficiency: ↑ 4.5 points”).
   - Use a visual metaphor like:
     - A comparison chart or simple before/after cards.
     - Copy like: “Here’s how your aircraft changes with this scenario.”

5. Integration:
   - Add a button or link from the Results page and/or Flight Deck page: “Open Scenario Simulator”.

Important constraints:
- Do NOT delete or radically rewrite existing files.
- Do NOT remove existing pages or routing.
- You ARE allowed to create new pages, new components, and new routes where needed.
- Only ADD or MODIFY what is necessary.
- Keep existing pages and routing working.
- Show me exactly which files you changed.
