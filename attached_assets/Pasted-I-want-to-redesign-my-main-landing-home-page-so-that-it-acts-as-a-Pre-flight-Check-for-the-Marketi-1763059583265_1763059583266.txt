I want to redesign my main landing/home page so that it acts as a “Pre-flight Check” for the Marketing Flight Deck.

Right now the homepage looks nice but is too generic and no longer asks for the key inputs (role, industry, team size, revenue, budget, etc.). I want to bring those inputs back in a structured way and combine them with the “Search for a Flight / Popular Journeys” layout similar to the mockups I have (three-column style).

Please update or create the main landing page component (e.g., `src/pages/LandingPage.js` or whatever file currently serves as the home route) with the following behavior and layout:

1. Overall Goals
   - The homepage should:
     - Collect the user’s basic context: role, industry, team size, revenue band, budget band, and goals.
     - Clearly explain what the Flight Deck does using the flight metaphor.
     - Provide clear CTAs:
       - Begin assessments
       - “Search for a flight” (choose journeys based on their context)
       - View popular journeys
       - See the Company A example (but not front-and-center)
     - Feel like a “Pre-flight Check” before entering the main cockpit.

2. Hero Section (top)
   - Keep or adapt the main hero copy along these lines:
     - Headline: “Chart Your Marketing Flight Path”
     - Subheadline: “Discover your current marketing capabilities, map your tech stack, and receive personalized transformation journeys for your team.”
   - Primary CTA button:
     - Label: “Begin Pre-flight Check”
     - This should scroll down to / focus the input section on the same page, or simply bring the user to the inputs immediately.
   - Secondary CTA buttons:
     - “See Company A Example” → navigate to the Company A Story page route (e.g., `/story/company-a`).
     - “Learn How It Works” → scroll to a “How Your Flight Plan Works” section lower on the page.

3. Pre-flight Inputs Section (the key missing piece)
   - Just below the hero, add a prominent card or panel titled something like:
     - “Pre-flight Check: Tell Us About Your Crew”
   - Inside this card, add form fields to capture:
     - Role (dropdown or buttons): CMO / Head of Marketing / Marketing Operations / Campaigns / Brand / Product Mar
